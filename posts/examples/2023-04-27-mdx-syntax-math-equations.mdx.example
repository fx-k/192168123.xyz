Mathematical equations can be rendered using [KaTeX](https://katex.org).

## Usage

Please read [KaTeX](https://katex.org) documentation for more details.

### Inline

Write inline math equations by wrapping LaTeX equations between `$`:

**Input**

```latex
Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.
```

**Output**

Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.

### Blocks

For equation block or display mode, use line breaks and `$$`:

**Input**

```latex
$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$
```

**Output**

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$
